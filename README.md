# 3D CSS Pug and SASS Mixins
Easily create your own CSS 3D shapes with these Pug and SASS Mixins! With these mixins, you are able to change the dimensions of these shapes without having to go through tedious amounts of HTML/CSS code.

Simply copy and paste the code from each .pug and .scss file into your own projects.

Note: you must copy and paste everything from the files. Once done, you will be able to use the mixins to create several cubes/spheres, so long as they are within a scene (both for sphere and cube), and a plane (only for cube).
